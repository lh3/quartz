This is a fork of the [Quartz][quartz] base quality compressor. It has a more
friendly command line interface, better parallelization, fewer library
dependencies and supports gzip'd FASTQ and BAM input/output. This fork still
requires a Quartz dictionary as input. For human, a multi-population dictionary
can be downloaded from the [Quartz][quartz] website. It is nontrivial to build
this by yourself.
